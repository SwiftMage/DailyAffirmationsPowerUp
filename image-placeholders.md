## Notes

- App Store badge (app-store-badge.svg) has already been created
- All screenshots should be from your actual app running on a device or simulator
- You can use tools like Photoshop, Figma, or online mockup generators to create the app preview image
- For best results, make sure all images have the same aspect ratio within each category (preview vs. screenshots)
- iPhone screenshots typically work best for app websites
