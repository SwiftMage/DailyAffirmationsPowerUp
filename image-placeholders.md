# Image Placeholders for Power Words Website

Before publishing the website, you'll need to create and add the following images to the `images/` directory:

## Required Images

1. **app-preview.png**
   - A mockup of the app shown on an iPhone or iPad
   - Recommended size: 600px × 1200px
   - This image appears in the hero section of the homepage

2. **panoramic-app-image.png**
   - A wide panoramic image showcasing multiple app screens together
   - Recommended size: 1200px × 500px
   - Shows multiple app screens side by side in one cohesive image
   - This replaces the need for individual screenshots

3. **app-store-badge.svg**
   - App Store download badge
   - Already created

## Notes

- App Store badge (app-store-badge.svg) has already been created
- The panoramic image should showcase all key screens of the app in a cohesive, visually appealing layout
- You can use tools like Photoshop, Figma, or online mockup generators to create both the app preview and panoramic images
- For best results, ensure the panoramic image has a consistent visual style
