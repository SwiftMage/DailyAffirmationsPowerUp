## Design Decisions

### Single Panoramic Image vs Multiple Screenshots
The website now uses a single panoramic image to showcase the app instead of multiple screenshots with titles. This decision was made to:
1. Create a more cohesive visual presentation
2. Simplify the UI
3. Provide a better mobile viewing experience
4. Allow for a more creative presentation of app screens

### Color Scheme
The website uses a blue-green color palette with:
- Primary: #4a86e8 (blue)
- Secondary: #63c8a5 (mint green)
- Accent: #f6b26b (orange)

These colors were chosen to evoke feelings of trust, growth, and energy.
