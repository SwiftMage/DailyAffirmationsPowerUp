## Implementation Details

The website has been updated to use a single panoramic image instead of multiple app screenshots with titles. This change simplifies the UI and provides a more cohesive visual presentation of the app's features.

### Technical Changes:

2. Added CSS styles for the new panoramic image with hover effects
3. Kept previous screenshot styles commented out for reference
4. Updated documentation to reflect the new image requirements
5. Updated privacy.html to clearly state that no personal user data is collected or stored.
6. Updated privacy.html again to disclose the use of RevenueCat for subscription management and the collection of anonymous purchase history for analytics and app functionality.
7. Replaced custom terms.html page with a link to Apple's standard EULA in footers.
8. Added links to terms.html in the footers of index.html and privacy.html.
9. Updated contact email address to appspire@icloud.com in index.html, privacy.html, and terms.html.
10. Performed a global find-and-replace for "Power Words" -> "Daily Affirmations Power Up!" in all HTML and Markdown files.
